# CapacityBidBattery
This repository is for capacity bidding of batteries in day-ahead markets for a given prediction of load and pv (can include wind in combination of pv by simply adding the power generated in MW). It constrains the power levels of the battery so that the contracted capacity is maintained in real-time.
