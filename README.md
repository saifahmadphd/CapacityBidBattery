# CapacityBidBattery
This repository is for optimal sizing of battery under capacity bidding in day-ahead markets for a given prediction of load and pv (can include wind in combination with pv by simply adding the power generated in MW). It constrains the energy and power level of the battery so that the contracted capacity is maintained in real-time.
